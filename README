Auto-saving the gVim window's size and position from previous launch (including a maximized gVim in a multi-monitors setup) and makes all the settings in the gVim's menu stick. If you change your font, it'll stick. Change your colorscheme? it'll stick, too. Enable/Disable the menu, toolbar and scrollbars? it'll stick.

Tested on standard installations of MacOSX, Ubuntu and Windows.

Only works with the GUI version of Vim. Can be made to work with terminal but it just makes more sense for the GUI version.

Options:
========
.vimrc options

>>    let g:setting_restore = 1
If non-zero, AutoSaveSetting is enabled at startup. Enabled by default (1).

>>    let g:setting_by_vim_instance = 1
If non-zero, save a different set of settings for each Vim instance. Enabled by default (1).
